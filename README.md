# Secure ML Contribution Framework

This project demonstrates a secure and version-controlled workflow for managing collaborative machine learning model updates using Git-Theta and cryptographic verification.

## Overview

The framework ensures that each contributed model update is:
- Authenticated using cryptographic signatures
- Validated using key ML performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
- Automatically accepted or rejected based on historical performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `git-theta` installed and added to your PATH
- Git configured with SSH or HTTPS access

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-ml-framework.git
cd secure-ml-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### How to Run
To test a model update and simulate contribution validation:
```bash
python run_demo.py
```
